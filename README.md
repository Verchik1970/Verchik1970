### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Vera Razvarina and I recently completed a professional retraining course in Software Testing with a specialization in JAVA at Skillfactory. Prior to this, I worked as a director at an advertising agency for 15 years.

Although my background may seem unconventional, I believe that my experience in management has equipped me with valuable skills that can be applied to the field of software testing. I am highly organized, detail-oriented, and have excellent communication skills. Additionally, my experience in project management has given me a strong understanding of the importance of meeting deadlines and delivering high-quality work.

As a recent graduate of Skillfactory's Software Testing program, I am proficient in various testing methodologies and tools, including Selenium WebDriver, TestNG, and JUnit. I am also experienced in creating test plans, test cases, and test scripts.

I am eager to continue learning and expanding my knowledge in the field of software testing. I am confident that my unique background and skillset make me a valuable asset to any team looking for a dedicated and driven automation tester.

Thank you for considering my profile. Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or would like to discuss my qualifications further.

Best regards,
Vera
